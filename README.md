## Projects
**[Azure CI/CD Pipeline using Azure Pipelines & Argo CD | Multi Microservice Project]**
- Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation for a microservice application with a tiered architecture. This application 
  consists of three separate microservices, each written in a different language. Redis is used for caching, and a MySQL 
  database holds user data. Azure CI Pipelines were used to create the pipeline for Python, DotNet, and Java applications. 
  Argo CD was used to deploy the microservices onto the Azure Kubernetes services.
