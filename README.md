## Work Experience
**Cloud Solution Engineer @ Ingram Micro Cloud (_April 2021 - Present_)**
- Designed and implemented end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using Microsoft Azure DevOps, and GitLab for multiple projects, 
  automating build, test, and deployment processes, resulting in significant time savings and increased efficiency.
- Implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using Terraform to automate the provisioning and configuration of Azure 
  resources, streamlining deployment processes and improving infrastructure consistency and repeatability.
- Utilized container orchestration tools like Kubernetes (AKS) to orchestrate Docker containers, streamlining CI/CD 
  pipelines. This optimized resource utilization and enabled seamless deployment across different environments.
- Led the migration of Azure cloud subscriptions from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) to the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) model, 
  providing technical expertise and support throughout the transition phase, resulting in improved cost management and 
  resource optimization.

## Projects
**Azure CI/CD Pipeline using Azure Pipelines & Argo CD | Multi Microservice Project**
- Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation for a microservice application with a tiered architecture. This application 
  consists of three separate microservices, each written in a different language. Redis is used for caching, and a MySQL 
  database holds user data. Azure CI Pipelines were used to create the pipeline for Python, DotNet, and Java applications. 
  Argo CD was used to deploy the microservices onto the Azure Kubernetes services.

**End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline for Infrastructure Provisioning Using Terraform and Azure DevOps| Terraform Project**
- Streamlined deployment procedures and enhanced infrastructure consistency and repeatability by implementing Infrastructure 
  as Code (IaC) techniques with Terraform to automate the provisioning and configuration of Azure resources via a CI/CD 
  pipeline. This involves multiple phases, including the Delete and Deploy phases. Upon review and approval, the 
  delete stage will be initiated, causing the infrastructure to be automatically deleted from the Azure Portal.
